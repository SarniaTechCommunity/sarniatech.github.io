title: How to Post to the Blog

The Sarnia Tech Community's website is power by a tool called [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com). Jekyll is a tool built with the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) programming language that lets you transform a set of input content files, into web browser friendly output files. This lets us have a fast, easily maintained, and flexible website. Oh, and the technology it runs on is free and open source, and the hosting is complimentary via [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com); turns out you can sometimes have and eat your cake!

There are two videos listed below. The first one is 20 minutes long and walks through the process of setting up your computer to be able to post to the website, and the second one is an **X** minute video demonstration of me posting this blog post. I know, very meta.
